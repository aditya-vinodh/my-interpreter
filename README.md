# Building an Interpreter

This is a learning project that is under development. I am learning the Zig programming language and decided to work on a project to understand it better. I have also been interested in compilers and interpreters so I decided it would be a good idea to create one using Zig.

I am following along Thorsten Ball's Book - *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. I am using it as a guide to understand the inner workings of an interpreter and then apply it using Zig.

I am also looking at source code for Zig's own Tokenizer for examples of real-world usage.

# Progress

So far I have a very basic lexer working. I am working on building a REPL.
